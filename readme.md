# Developer Challenge
Thanks for being interested in a job at Turner Broadcasting.  You will have 24 hours from receipt of this document to:

* Write the code to complete the challenge
* Push it up to a github or bitbucket repository
* Send us the URL for the repo.

We will then clone your repository, run the code, and assess your solution.

## The Problem

We would like you to create a website that allows users to:

* Search for a Title by it's name.
* Display the titles that match the above criteria.
* Allow the user to pull up detailed information about a selected title from the list.
* Look in the email we sent you for any additional requirements (if any).

## Data

The database that contains the title data is provided in 2 forms, Mongo and SQL Lite.  Unless otherwise directed, you can use either one of these for the exercise.  **Each one has the same data, so only choose one.**

The connect string for the Mongo database is: mongodb://readuser:reader1234@SG-mssmongodev02-874.servers.mongodirector.com:27017/dev-test

The SQL Lite file is in the repository source as "database\Titles.sdf"

## Code
Unless otherwise directed, you have two options for building the website, .Net and node.js.  **There is a very good chance we will request you to use a specific framework, so double check the email we sent you to ensure you pick the correct one.**

## Hints

* Do your best to impress us.
* Expect us to use Lint your javascript
* Form is as important as function.  If your app works, but is written like a website from 2001, this will be bad.
* We're suckers for new technologies (i.e. Angular, media queries, MVC 4, Handlebars).
* Creativity: Don't like our requirements? Feel free to enhance this app as you see fit.
* Feel free to host the app somewhere (Azure, EC2, AppHarbor, etc)
